# Axion-NonStandard-Cosmologies
The Mathematica file contains functions that solve for the present axion energy density from the misalignment mechanism in different cosmological background.
More in depth, I obtain the axion energy density in the following scenarios:
I)   Standard cosmological model, using either time or temperature as the independent variable.
II)  Broken power-law model, with emphasis on the low-reheat temperature and the kination scenarios.
III) Background given by the solution to coupled Boltzmann equations.
IV)  Background given by scalar-tensor theories.
